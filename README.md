# RenDance
A repository of Renaissance dance information, put up by Susan and
Nathan Kronenfeld.

This information is free for use, with attribution, for non-commercial
use - we will determine under exactly what license soon.

For commercial use, please contact us - it would probably be similarly
free for use, but until we know what possible commercial use one might
make of this, we wish to reserve those rights.
