# The Il Papa manuscript

This repository contains a transcription, translation, and set of
reconstructiongs of the Il Papa manuscript.  This manuscript
contains an introduction, and 15 dances by three authors, known
only as Giovannino, Il Lanzino, and Il Papa.  Two dances each are
assigned to Il Lanzino and Il Papa; the remaining 11 are assigned
to Giovannino.  The introduction is signed by Il Papa, hence the
common name of the manuscript.

The original manuscript is in
