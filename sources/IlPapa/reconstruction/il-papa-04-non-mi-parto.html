    We have three thoughts for measures 60-65, none of which are wholly satisfactory:
    <ul>
      <li>"Straight towards one another" means around the circle.
        This is not satisfactory because he uses "in a circle" to mean
        that in other places.</li>
      <li>"Straight towards one another" indicates facing, not
        direction of motion, and one does the P P t backwards, and the
        P P P forwards to end in the circle in which one began.  This
        is unsatisfactory because it assumes a lot that isn't
        there.</li>
      <li>Do what it litterally says for the P P t P P P - all
        backwards.  Then, on the <em class="foreign">riprese</em>,
        assume his "do these in a circle" means spiraling inward.
        This is unsatisfactory because it inserts a whole instruction
        that simply isn't there.</li>
