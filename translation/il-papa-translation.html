    <!-- TODO:
         universal: Lots of things are in parentheses, probably
         because we weren't sure about them.  Now that we have a
         better copy of the text, we should double-check all these
         parentheses. **Update: Actually, a lot of the parentheses, especially around just a few letters, are the correct way to mark letters understood in abbreviated words.  Not a terrible idea to check though, just in case.
      -->
    <h2>Translation notes</h2>
    <p> There are a few notations in the text of the translation. </p>
    <p> We do not give word-to-word correspondance between original
      and translation - such would make little sense, as there isn't
      always a word-to-word correspondence between Italian and English.
      Instead, we break the text up into individual instructions.  The
      page formatting should show a clear correspondence between our
      transcription of the original Italian, and our translation. </p>
    <p> The reader often will encounter in our transcription the
      notation, "(n)".  This notation means an n is indicated, not
      by writing out the letter, but by putting a macron over the
      following vowel.  This is a standard abbrebiation in
      manuscripts of the time.   Similar, other text in
      parentheses in the transcription indicates that the text is
      abbreviated in the original (e.g., "(m)" for a similar
      macron, "(questo)" for a q and a squiggly z, surmounted by
      an o).</p>
    <p> Line numbers are specified as
      triplets: <mark class="line-ref">A:B:C</mark>, where A specifies
      the leaf, B the page, and C the line within that page.  The
      leaf and page specification is somewhat redundant, but more
      information seemed better tha less. </p>

    <h3>Punctuation and Sentence Structure</h3>
    <p>
      The original text of the manuscript contains very little in the
      way of capital letters or punctuation.  Treated literally, much
      of the text would be impossibly long run-on sentences.  We have
      chosen, instead, to take the opposite course, and break the text
      up into as small units of meaning as possible, using textual
      clues.  The biggest such clues are the uses
      of <em class="foreign">dipoi</em> (meaning “then...”)
      and <em class="foreign">e</em> (meaning
      “and...”).  <em class="foreign">Dipoi</em> we believe pretty
      much universally introduces a new
      phrase.  <em class="foreign">E</em> is used less consistently,
      but when one eliminates the cases where it is joining two
      obvious words, most of the time, it seems to be used to
      introduce a new phrase.  If one wants to look for other
      interpretations, just turn what we have written as adjoining
      sentences into one run-on sentence.  Doing so should allow more
      conceptual latitude for alternatives without loss of accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as not to lose any information, we have indicated what few
      capitals there are in the original by putting the first word (in
      translation) of the sentence containing the words so capitalized
      in bold in our version.  We don’t just bold the first letter, so
      that these points are more easily found, and we bold the first
      word in the sentence, rather than the exact word, as word order
      can differ between Italian and English.  These capitalized words
      also seem to correspond to the beginnings of paragraphs in the
      original.  We saw a theory, we believe in an article by Cain
      (unfortunately we lost the reference, but if it was the Cain
      article, and not a Sparti article, it was in one of the
      Historical Dance Society proceedings since Cain has been
      publishing on the subject) that these capitals correspond to the
      beginning of sections in the music and in the dance.
    </p>

    <h3>Dreto</h3>
    <p>
      Both <em class="foreign">adreto</em>
      (modern: <em class="foreign">addietro</em>
      or <em class="foreign">a dietro</em>)
      and <em class="foreign">indreto</em>
      (modern: <em class="foreign">indietro</em>
      or <em class="foreign">in dietro</em>) essentially mean “back”
      or “backwards” (depending on context).  However,
      the <em class="foreign">Grande dizionario della lingua
      italiana</em> (vol. [x], pp. 800-802) offers as sense #2
      for <em class="foreign">indietro</em>, “<em class="foreign">al
      luogo di origine; al punto di partenza</em>”, indicating
      that <em class="foreign">indietro</em> also has a meaning of
      retracing one’s steps, of returning to the point of departure.
      No such sense is given for <em class="foreign">addietro</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, a native speaker of Italian has told us
      that <em class="foreign">in dietro</em> is backwards in a
      spatial sense, <em class="foreign">a dietro</em>, in a
      conceptual sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, before taking this difference too seriously, one should
      note there are cases, such as
      in <a href="il-papa-04-non-mi-parto.html#4:8:21-22">Non mi
      parto, 4:8:21-22</a>
      and <a href="il-papa-04-non-mi-parto.html#4:8:24-25">4:8:24-25</a>
      where the two seem to be used interchangeably. Though on the
      third hand, we can come up with interpretations even for this
      section where the meanings are different.
    </p>

    <p>
      It may be that any such fine interpretations should be taken with a grain of salt, but this is best left to the informed discretion of the reconstructor.
    </p>

    <h3>Incontrosi</h3>
    <p>
      This term (also sometimes <em class="foreign">(in)contro al(la)
      [x]</em>) has a root of <em class="foreign">contra</em>,
      “opposite” or “against”.  The term seems to occur most commonly
      where the lady (middle person of a trio) has separated from the
      men, and they are facing each other across a space, and they are
      moving towards one another, perhaps meaning “facing the opposite
      direction” - i.e. towards one another.  Sometimes they actually
      meet at the end of the given steps, and sometimes it is not
      specified that they do.  It is not impossible that they are
      going <em class="foreign">incontro</em> one another by moving
      farther apart, except that sometimes the text explicitly states
      that they come beside one another.  By
      contrast, <em class="foreign">voltinsi faccia</em> (“they turn
      their faces”) and like expressions seem to denote that they have
      turned away from one another and are moving apart.
    </p>

	<h3>Passo, Volta, Tempo</h3>
	<p>
	  These three words present similar problems: they all seem to
	  have a sense that is dance jargon, and a sense that is a simple,
	  everyday word.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We have probably treated <em class="foreign">passo</em> ("step")
	  the most rigorously; our goal was to assume jargon unless it was
	  very clearly otherwise.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <em class="foreign">Volta</em> ("turn") and <em class="tempo">
	  ("time") we have tried to be more discerning, attempting
	  translate them when they are used as a simple word, and leave
	  them as is when we consider their usage to be jargon.  If we
	  have decided wrong (which we surely have somewhere), we
	  appologize.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The verb form
	  of <em class="foreign">volta</em>, <em class="foreign">voltare</em>,
	  we have attempted always to translate.
	</p>
